This is a app built in Django for sending tweets to a live Twitter stream associated with the app. You will need to register with twitter to get access and consumer keys. 

The following frameowrks were used:
Django 
Backbone.js
Jquery
Twitter Bootstrap
LESS CSS

A Postgres database was used as well.

In this version of the app tweet_list.js uses Backbone.js and Jquery. 

The tweet.js which is resposible for sending, verifying, brand correcting and  filtering tweets uses jquery and ajax. I intend to port that script to to backbone.js

PLEASE Note: The previous commit names are vagrant because vagrant was the user account being used under the virtualbox where I made the commit to github. I corrected this by setting the appropriate global settings for git on the virtual box.
